# Introduction 
Trinidad and Tobago's e-commerce market are relatively small when compared to other countries, and the adoption of e-commerce by brick-and-mortar businesses in the country has been slow or non-existent. Despite this, many businesses have not taken full advantage of the opportunities that come with implementing an e-commerce platform to solve their everyday business challenges. This project aims to conduct an independent analysis of Motee and Son's, a family business that has been operating in the retail sector for the past 25 years.
